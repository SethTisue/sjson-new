### SLIP-28 Scala JSON: Fix unsafe.JObject parse ordering

In the SLIP-28 Scala JSON support module, fix a bug in parsing `unsafe.JObject` - instead of an interim `mutable.Map` use
an `ArrayBuffer`.

[#35][35] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]

### fixes and enhancements

- Write out field names for LList as `$fields` so it does not depend on the implementation of AST. [#40][40] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Define `LNil` as a value so its type is `LNil` instead of `LNil.type`.
