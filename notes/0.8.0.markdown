### ScalaJSON support

[ScalaJSON](https://github.com/mdedetrich/scalajson), formerly SLIP-28 JSON proposal, is graduating the incubation, and changed its group id (organization). However, it is still in development and final 1.0 is not out yet.

To avoid runtime errors in the future, sjson-new 0.8.0-M3 provides codec support for a shaded release of ScalaJSON 1.0.0-M4, as well as Jawn binding for parsing and pretty/compact printers.
